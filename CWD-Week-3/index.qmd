# Overview

1. AMA
2. Quarto Things
3. Essential Differences between Quarto and RMarkdown
4. Adding to a Portfolio with Quarto, Distil, or Blogdown

## The Assignment for this week

Create a minimal portfolio.  Three ways.  Let's talk about them.

## `usethis`

- [The main page:](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis)
- [The served version](https://usethis.r-lib.org/index.html)
- [PAT's](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/github-token.html)

Setting this up makes interacting with `Git` far easier from RStudio.

## Snippets

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Check out my snippet

- Activate them with [Shift]+[Tab]
- I learned they require arguments
- [RStudio Forums](https://community.rstudio.com/t/snippet-for-multicolumn-in-quarto-markdown/158654)

::: {.column width="50%"}

## AMA

1. `#tidyTuesday` as a source of data and an awesome collection of neat visualizations
2. Resources: `stackoverflow` and [Posit Community](https://community.rstudio.com/)

## An Example

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}

Note: requires `hrbrthemes`

```{r C1, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x=disp, y=mpg, color=cyl) + 
  geom_point()
```
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
```{r C2, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
mtcars %>% ggplot() + aes(x=disp, y=mpg, color=cyl) + geom_point()
```
:::

## The Structure of an RMarkdown/Quarto document

1. The top stuff in between three dashes is YAML [YAML is not a Markup Language]
2. The markdown syntax
3. Code chunks and options within them [the indicated methods differ a little between RMarkdown and Quarto but the old/RMarkdown method works]

They are nearly identical but quarto has some amazing features.

## On a Portfolio

Preliminary questions: 

1. Where do you want to host it?  Do you need a fancy domain name?
   - The github main page trick [this is not well documented that I can find]
2. Setting up rendering?
3. Templates 
   - Also, quarto websites and blogs.

## Quarto things

- [The Documents](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/)
- [Blogs are largely a subset](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html)
- The Amazing Quarto thread

## Essential Differences

1. Quarto is probably more reliable long-term.
2. There are remarkably few differences and most are in YAML
3. Quarto YAML is literate.
4. Quarto code chunk options follow a new format.

## Some of the most important for your portfolio

Code folding:

## Default Theming

**NEVER USE DEFAULT THEMES**

1. They're ugly.
2. It makes people wonder if you understand theming.

[A blog post](https://robertwwalker.github.io/DADM-FAQ/posts/default-ggplot-theme-set/)

```
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

## Let's explore those in turn

## The `pdxrug` talk

Though it is about presentations, all kinds of things can be done.

## on tidyTuesday

For next week's assignment, browse the tidyTuesday archives, find a visualization, and try a modification of it in a post.  Or some other post of interest. So that we know how to extend it.  We are going to add to it from here.

## Adding to the Portfolio

Once the workflow is correct, it should be straightforward.  I typically just copy a post, delete all the stuff, and use that as a template.
