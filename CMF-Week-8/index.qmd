- **how do we measure ``easiest''?**
- **what makes something easy/difficult to forecast?**

## Forecastability factors

Something is easier to forecast if:

1. we have a good understanding of the factors that contribute to it
2. there is lots of data available;
3. the future is somewhat similar to the past
4. the forecasts cannot affect the thing we are trying to forecast.

# A Smart Man

``He who sees the past as surprise-free is bound to have a future full of surprises.''
- Amos Tversky


## Statistical forecasting

- Thing to be forecast: a random variable, $y_t$.
- Forecast distribution: If ${\cal I}$ is all observations, then $y_{t} |{\cal I}$ means "the random variable $y_{t}$ given what we know in ${\cal I}$.
- The "point forecast" is the mean (or median) of $y_{t} |{\cal I}$
- The "forecast variance" is $\text{var}[y_{t} |{\cal I}]$
- A prediction interval or "interval forecast" is a range of values of $y_t$ with high probability.
- With time series, ${y}_{t|t-1} = y_t | \{y_1,y_2,\dots,y_{t-1}\}$.
- $\hat{y}_{T+h|T} =\text{E}[y_{T+h} | y_1,\dots,y_T]$ (an $h$-step forecast taking account of all observations up to time $T$).


# Time series in R

## `tsibble` objects are `index` and `key`

## `tsibble` objects

```{r, echo = TRUE}
global_economy
```


## `tsibble` objects


```{r, echo = TRUE}
tourism
```

## `tsibble` objects

* A `tsibble` allows storage and manipulation of multiple time series in R.

* It contains:

  + An index: time information about the observation
  + Measured variable(s): numbers of interest
  + Key variable(s): optional unique identifiers for each series

* It works with tidyverse functions.

## The `tsibble` index

### Example

```{r tstable, cache=TRUE}
mydata <- tsibble(
    year = 2012:2016,
    y = c(123, 39, 78, 52, 110),
    index = year
)
mydata
```

## The `tsibble` index

### Example

```{r astsibble, cache=TRUE}
mydata <- tibble(
    year = 2012:2016,
    y = c(123, 39, 78, 52, 110)
  ) %>%
  as_tsibble(index = year)
mydata
```

## The `tsibble` index

```
For observations more frequent than once per year, we need to use a time class function on the index.
```

```{r tstablemonth, echo=FALSE}
z <- tibble(Month = paste(2019, month.abb[1:5]), Observation = c(50, 23, 34, 30, 25))
# knitr::kable(z, booktabs=TRUE)
```

```{r tstablemonth2}
z
```

## The `tsibble` index

```
For observations more frequent than once per year, we need to use a time class function on the index.
```

```{r month-tsibble}
z %>%
  mutate(Month = yearmonth(Month)) %>%
  as_tsibble(index = Month)
```

## The `tsibble` index

Common time index variables can be created with these functions:

###
```{r tstable2, echo=FALSE}
tribble(
  ~`Frequency`, ~Function,
  "Annual", "`start:end`",
  "Quarterly", "`yearquarter()`",
  "Monthly", "`yearmonth()`",
  "Weekly", "`yearweek()`",
  "Daily", "`as_date()`, `ymd()`",
  "Sub-daily", "`as_datetime()`"
) %>%
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE)
```

    key = c(state, gender, legal, indigenous)
  )
```

```{r prison5a, dependson="prison5", echo=FALSE}

```

# Example: Australian pharmaceutical sales

## Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme

![pills](./figs/pills.jpg)

## Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme

**The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is the Australian government drugs subsidy scheme.**

- Many drugs bought from pharmacies are subsidised to allow more equitable access to modern drugs.
- The cost to government is determined by the number and types of drugs purchased. Currently nearly 1\% of GDP.
- The total cost is budgeted based on forecasts of drug usage.
- Costs are disaggregated by drug type (ATC1 x`r length(unique(PBS$ATC1))` / ATC2 `r length(unique(PBS$ATC2))`), concession category (x`r length(unique(PBS$Concession))`) and patient type (x`r length(unique(PBS$Type))`), giving $84\times2\times2=`r 84*2*2`$ time series.

## Working with `tsibble` objects {-}

```{r wide, include=FALSE}
options(width = 78)
```

```{r pbs1, dependson='wide'}
PBS
```

## Working with `tsibble` objects {-}

We can use the `filter()` function to select rows.

```{r pbs2}
PBS %>%
  filter(ATC2 == "A10")
```

## Working with `tsibble` objects {-}

We can use the `select()` function to select columns.

```{r pbs3}
PBS %>%
  filter(ATC2 == "A10") %>%
  select(Month, Concession, Type, Cost)
```

## Working with `tsibble` objects {-}

We can use the `summarise()` function to summarise over keys.

```{r pbs4}
PBS %>%
  filter(ATC2 == "A10") %>%
  select(Month, Concession, Type, Cost) %>%
  summarise(total_cost = sum(Cost))
```

## Working with `tsibble` objects {-}

We can use the `mutate()` function to create new variables.

```{r pbs5}
PBS %>%
  filter(ATC2 == "A10") %>%
  select(Month, Concession, Type, Cost) %>%
  summarise(total_cost = sum(Cost)) %>%
  mutate(total_cost = total_cost / 1e6)
```

## Working with `tsibble` objects {-}

We can use the `mutate()` function to create new variables.

```{r pbs6}
PBS %>%
  filter(ATC2 == "A10") %>%
  select(Month, Concession, Type, Cost) %>%
  summarise(total_cost = sum(Cost)) %>%
  mutate(total_cost = total_cost / 1e6) -> a10
```

```{r a10, echo=FALSE, dependson="pbs6"}
a10
```

```{r narrow, include=FALSE}
options(width = 60)
```

# Time plots

## Time plots

```{r}
a10 %>%
  autoplot(total_cost)
```

## Ansett airlines

```{r}
ansett %>%
  autoplot(Passengers)
```

## Ansett airlines

```{r}
ansett %>%
  filter(Class == "Economy") %>%
  autoplot(Passengers)
```

## Ansett airlines {.smaller}

```{r}
ansett %>%
  filter(Airports == "MEL-SYD") %>%
  autoplot(Passengers)
```

## Time series patterns

- Trend: pattern exists when there is a long-term increase or decrease in the data.

- Seasonal: pattern exists when a series is influenced by seasonal factors (e.g., the quarter of the year, the month, or day of the week).

- Cyclic: pattern exists when data exhibit rises and falls that are \emph{not of fixed period} (duration usually of at least 2 years).

## Time series components

### Differences between seasonal and cyclic patterns:

- seasonal pattern constant length; cyclic pattern variable length
- average length of cycle longer than length of seasonal pattern
- magnitude of cycle more variable than magnitude of seasonal pattern

## Time series patterns {.smaller}

```{r}
aus_production %>%
  filter(year(Quarter) >= 1980) %>%
  autoplot(Electricity) +
  labs(y = "GWh", title = "Australian electricity production")
```

## Time series patterns

```{r, warning=FALSE}
aus_production %>%
  autoplot(Bricks) +
  labs(y = "million units", title = "Australian clay brick production")
```

## Time series patterns

```{r}
us_employment %>%
  filter(Title == "Retail Trade", year(Month) >= 1980) %>%
  autoplot(Employed / 1e3) +
  labs(y = "Million people", title = "Retail employment, USA")
```

## Time series patterns

```{r}
gafa_stock %>%
  filter(Symbol == "AMZN", year(Date) >= 2018) %>%
  autoplot(Close) +
  labs(y = "$US", title = "Amazon closing stock price")
```

## Time series patterns

```{r}
pelt %>%
  autoplot(Lynx) +
  labs(y="Number trapped", title = "Annual Canadian Lynx Trappings")
```

## Seasonal or cyclic?

**Differences between seasonal and cyclic patterns:**

- seasonal pattern constant length; cyclic pattern variable length
- average length of cycle longer than length of seasonal pattern
- magnitude of cycle more variable than magnitude of seasonal pattern


```
The timing of peaks and troughs is predictable with seasonal data, but unpredictable in the long term with cyclic data.
```

# Seasonal and subseries plots

## Seasonal plots

```{r, echo=TRUE, dependson="a10", fig.height=3.3}
a10 %>% gg_season(total_cost, labels = "both") +
  labs(y = "$ million", title = "Seasonal plot: antidiabetic drug sales")
```

## Seasonal plots

- Data plotted against the individual "seasons" in which the data were observed.  (In this case a "season" is a month.)
- Something like a time plot except that the data from each season are overlapped.
- Enables the underlying seasonal pattern to be seen more clearly, and also allows any substantial departures from the seasonal pattern to be easily identified.
- In R: `gg_season()`

## Seasonal subseries plots


```{r, echo=TRUE, dependson="a10"}
a10 %>%
  gg_subseries(total_cost) +
  labs(y = "$ million", title = "Subseries plot: antidiabetic drug sales")
```

## Seasonal subseries plots

- Data for each season collected together in time plot as separate time series.
- Enables the underlying seasonal pattern to be seen clearly, and changes in seasonality over time to be visualized.
- In R: `gg_subseries()`

## Quarterly Australian Beer Production

```{r}
beer <- aus_production %>%
  select(Quarter, Beer) %>%
  filter(year(Quarter) >= 1992)
beer %>% autoplot(Beer)
```

## Quarterly Australian Beer Production

```{r}
beer %>% gg_season(Beer, labels="right")
```

## Quarterly Australian Beer Production

```

## Multiple seasonal periods

```{r}

```

## Multiple seasonal periods

```{r, dev = "png", dpi = 180}
vic_elec %>% gg_season(Demand, period = "week")
```

## Multiple seasonal periods

vic_elec %>% gg_season(Demand, period = "day")
```

## Australian holidays

holidays <- tourism %>%
  filter(Purpose == "Holiday") %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarise(Trips = sum(Trips))

  labs(y = "thousands of trips", title = "Australian domestic holiday nights")
```

## Seasonal plots

```{r graphics1, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, out.width="45%"}
holidays %>% gg_season(Trips) +
  labs(y = "thousands of trips", title = "Australian domestic holiday nights")
```

## Seasonal subseries plots

```{r graphics2, fig.height=3.1}
holidays %>%
  gg_subseries(Trips) +
  labs(y = "thousands of trips", title = "Australian domestic holiday nights")
```

# Lag plots and autocorrelation

## Example: Beer production

```{r}
new_production <- aus_production %>%
  filter(year(Quarter) >= 1992)
new_production
```

## Example: Beer production

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, out.width="6.5cm"}
new_production %>% gg_lag(Beer)
```

## Example: Beer production

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, out.width="6.5cm"}
new_production %>% gg_lag(Beer, geom='point')
```

## Lagged scatterplots

Each graph shows $y_t$ plotted against $y_{t-k}$ for
different values of $k$.
- The autocorrelations are the correlations associated
with these scatterplots.
- ACF (autocorrelation function):
     - $r_1=\text{Correlation}(y_{t}, y_{t-1})$
     - $r_2=\text{Correlation}(y_{t}, y_{t-2})$
     - $r_3=\text{Correlation}(y_{t}, y_{t-3})$
     - etc.

## Autocorrelation

**Covariance** and **correlation**: measure extent of **linear relationship** between two variables ($y$ and $X$).

**Autocovariance** and **autocorrelation**: measure linear relationship between **lagged values** of a time series $y$.

We measure the relationship between:

- $y_{t}$ and $y_{t-1}$
- $y_{t}$ and $y_{t-2}$
- $y_{t}$ and $y_{t-3}$
- etc.

## Autocorrelation

We denote the sample autocovariance at lag $k$ by $c_k$ and the sample autocorrelation at lag $k$ by $r_k$.  Then define

$$
c_k = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=k+1}^T (y_t-\bar{y})(y_{t-k}-\bar{y})
$$
$$
r_{k} = c_k/c_0
$$

- $r_1$ indicates how successive values of  $y$  relate to each other
- $r_2$ indicates how  $y$ values two periods apart relate to each other
- $r_k$ is \textit{almost} the same as the sample correlation between $y_t$ and $y_{t-k}$.

## Autocorrelation

Results for first 9 lags for beer data:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
new_production %>% ACF(Beer, lag_max = 9)
```

## Autocorrelation

Results for first 9 lags for beer data:

```{r beeracf, fig.height=2}
new_production %>% ACF(Beer, lag_max = 9) %>% autoplot()
```

  * Together, the autocorrelations at lags 1, 2, \dots, make up the \emph{autocorrelation} or ACF.
  * The plot is known as a **correlogram**


## Autocorrelation

```{r beeracf2, fig.height=2}
new_production %>% ACF(Beer) %>% autoplot()
```

  * $r_{4}$  higher than for the other lags. This is due to **the seasonal pattern in the data**: the peaks tend to be **4 quarters** apart and the troughs tend to be **2 quarters** apart.
  * $r_2$ is more negative than for the other lags because troughs tend to be 2 quarters behind peaks.

## Trend and seasonality in ACF plots

- When data have a trend, the autocorrelations for small lags tend to be large and positive.
- When data are seasonal, the autocorrelations will be larger at the seasonal lags (i.e., at multiples of the seasonal frequency)
- When data are trended and seasonal, you see a combination of these effects.

# White noise

## Example: White noise

```{r wn}
set.seed(30)
wn <- tsibble(t = 1:50, y = rnorm(50), index = t)
wn %>% autoplot(y)
```

**White noise data is uncorrelated across time with zero mean and constant variance.**

(Technically, we require independence as well.)

## Example: White noise

```r
wn %>% ACF(y)
```

```{r wnacf, echo=FALSE, dependson="wn"}
wn %>%
  ACF(y, lag_max = 10) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(lag = as.numeric(lag)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = lag, values_from = acf) %>%
  rename_all(function(x) {
    paste("$r_{", x, "}$", sep = "")
  }) %>%
  knitr::kable(
    booktabs = TRUE,
    escape = FALSE, align = "c", digits = 3,
    format.args = list(nsmall = 3)
  )
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=1.5}
wn %>%
  ACF(y) %>%
  autoplot()
```


- Sample autocorrelations for white noise series.
- Expect each autocorrelation to be close to zero.
- Blue lines show 95% critical values.


## Sampling distribution of autocorrelations

Sampling distribution of $r_k$ for white noise data is asymptotically N(0,$1/T$).\pause

-  95% of all $r_k$ for white noise must lie within $\pm 1.96/\sqrt{T}$.
- If this is not the case, the series is probably not WN.
- Common to plot lines at $\pm 1.96/\sqrt{T}$ when plotting ACF.
These are the **critical values**.

## Example: Pigs slaughtered

```{r, fig.height=2.7}
pigs <- aus_livestock %>%
  filter(State == "Victoria", Animal == "Pigs", year(Month) >= 2014)
pigs %>% autoplot(Count/1e3) +
  labs(y = "Thousands", title = "Number of pigs slaughtered in Victoria")
```

## Example: Pigs slaughtered


```{r}
pigs %>% ACF(Count) %>% autoplot()
```

## Example: Pigs slaughtered

Monthly total number of pigs slaughtered
in the state of Victoria, Australia, from January 2014 through December 2018

- Difficult to detect pattern in time plot.
- ACF shows significant autocorrelation for lag 2 and 12.
- Indicate some slight seasonality.

These show the series is **not a white noise series**.

## Let's Try One

You can compute the daily changes in the Google stock price in 2018 using


```{r, eval = FALSE}
dgoog <- gafa_stock %>%
  filter(Symbol == "GOOG", year(Date) >= 2018) %>%
  mutate(diff = difference(Close))
```

Does `diff` look like white noise?
