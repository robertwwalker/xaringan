## The Problem(s)

- Screen shares on Zoom [and competitors] aren't copy-pasteable.
- Latency issues and interference often require that in-person learners are in the physical but not the virtual meeting.
- **Ultimately, this is an equity issue.**

## The Solution is Really That Easy

## How Does it Work?

Two versions are rendered.

- {filename}.html [A link to provide to users]
- {filename}-speaker.html [A link for the presenter]

- [The Details](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#multiplex-server)

## Behind The Scenes

- They are linked together via a server provided by the Revealjs team.
