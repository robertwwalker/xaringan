# Data are Ubiquitous

We can talk about them in terms of formats and types.  

**A format describes a machine readable method for storing and transporting data.**  Examples include .csv, .tsv, .dta, .xls, .xlsx, .por and many, many others.

**A type (or better, a storage type) describes the language of machine readability for any given variable.**  Examples include dates and times, numeric [double/float/single], integer, character, factor, logical [TRUE/FALSE], and complex [combining real and imaginary parts].

# Formats

Proprietary software often has a unique data format.  Stata has *.dta*  SAS files and SPSS .sav and .por files can be imported.

We will work with `.xls` and `.xlsx` formats most.  These are Excel's spreadsheet formats.  These are not generally human readable.

I often use .csv files; these are basic text files where a comma *delimits* -- separates -- cells.  These are human readable.  **I prefer that in the name of transparency.**

## Importing Data

The action is here [and it works for both URL and local files]:

## Import from Excel

```{r ExcelRead}
library(readxl)
url <- "https://github.com/robertwwalker/DADMStuff/raw/master/AnimalCrossing.xlsx"
destfile <- "ACrossing.xlsx"
curl::curl_download(url, destfile)
Critic <- read_excel(destfile, sheet="critic")
Items <- read_excel(destfile, sheet="Items")
Villagers <- read_excel(destfile, sheet="Villagers")
User_reviews <- read_excel(destfile, sheet="User_reviews")
```

Cool.  The url for the images are in the data so RMarkdown can access them.

![admiral](`r Villagers$url[1]`)

![angus](`r Villagers$url[13]`)

## Importing from .csv

They are text files.  Let's actually look at brexit.csv.  Three variables: date, percent right, percent wrong.  Separated by commas.  The comma is the 'delimiter'.

# Importing .csv

Grab the economist data.

```{r}
brexit <- read.csv("https://github.com/robertwwalker/DADMStuff/raw/master/brexit.csv")
corbyn <- read.csv("https://github.com/robertwwalker/DADMStuff/raw/master/corbyn.csv")
eu_balance <- read.csv("https://github.com/robertwwalker/DADMStuff/raw/master/eu_balance.csv")
pensions <- read.csv("https://github.com/robertwwalker/DADMStuff/raw/master/pensions.csv")
dogs <- read.csv("https://github.com/robertwwalker/DADMStuff/raw/master/dogs.csv")
trade <- read.csv("https://github.com/robertwwalker/DADMStuff/raw/master/trade.csv")
women_research <- read.csv("https://github.com/robertwwalker/DADMStuff/raw/master/women_research.csv")
```

# brexit in R

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
brexit
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
brexit %>% kable(., "html") %>% kable_styling() %>% scroll_box(height="400px", width="80%")
```

---
# Fixing the Dates

Dates are difficult.  Generically, they need to scale to hours, minutes, seconds, and perhaps worst, time zones.  In addition, they can be formatted in myriad ways.

```{r}
brexit <- brexit %>% mutate(date = as.Date(date, format="%d/%m/%y")) # These are dd/mm/yy
```

This is important, particularly if we wish to sequence them according to time, and we do when we visualize them.

---
# To Esquisse

I will need to reorganize the data; I need to make it `tidy`.  This is known as **pivoting**.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
brexitL <- brexit %>% pivot_longer(., c(percent_responding_right,percent_responding_wrong), names_to = "Choice", values_to="Percent")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
brexitL <- brexit %>% pivot_longer(., c(percent_responding_right,percent_responding_wrong), names_to = "Choice", values_to="Percent")
kable(brexitL) %>% kable_styling() %>% scroll_box(height="400px")
```
